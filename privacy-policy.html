        </header>

        <main>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdatedDate">[Insert Date of Last Update, e.g., October 26, 2023]</span></p>

            <p>FCS Tools ("we", "us", or "our") operates the FCS Buy Now Button Generator Shopify application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

            <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>We strive to collect as little personal information as possible to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

            <h3>Types of Data Collected:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shopify Store Information:</strong> When you install the Service, we may access certain information from your Shopify store account, such as your store's domain, email address for contact, and general store settings necessary for the app's functionality. This information is provided by Shopify upon installation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage Data (App Functionality):</strong> Our Service, "FCS Buy Now Button Generator," primarily functions by modifying the appearance and behavior of product pages within your Shopify theme. It does **not** directly collect or store personal information about your customers (e.g., names, addresses, payment details of your end-users). The app's configuration settings (e.g., button text, display preferences) are stored within your Shopify theme's settings or via Shopify's App Block system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Technical Data (If Applicable):</strong> We may collect limited, non-personally identifiable technical information when you interact with our app settings interface (not your storefront), such as IP address (for security and preventing abuse), browser type, and operating system for the purpose of improving our Service and ensuring its compatibility.
                    <em>[**Note:** Be very specific here. If you use analytics for your app's admin interface, state it.]</em>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
            <p>FCS Tools uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain our Service (i.e., enable the "Buy It Now" button functionality).</li>
                <li>To allow you to customize features of our Service.</li>
                <li>To provide customer support.</li>
                <li>To monitor the usage of our Service (e.g., installation counts, feature usage within the app's admin, not individual storefront button clicks) to improve it.</li>
                <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do **not** use any data related to your customers or their interactions with the "Buy It Now" button on your storefront for any purpose other than enabling the button's core functionality as configured by you.</p>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>
                Configuration data for the app (such as button text and display settings) is typically stored within your Shopify theme's data structures or through Shopify's App Data mechanisms. We rely on Shopify's security measures for data stored within their platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any minimal data we might temporarily process or log for support or technical troubleshooting is handled with care. The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any minimal Personal Data we might handle, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
             <em>[**Note:** If you use any third-party services to store ANY data, even anonymized or aggregated, you MUST disclose them here and link to their privacy policies.]</em>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Shopify store information or any other identifiable data to third parties.</p>
            <p>We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of FCS Tools.</li>
                <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.</li>
                <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Your Data Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Since our app primarily relies on Shopify's infrastructure and data storage:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have the right to access, update, or delete the information Shopify holds about your store by managing your Shopify account.</li>
                <li>If you uninstall the app, any data stored within Shopify's App Data specific to our app should be managed according to Shopify's data retention policies for uninstalled apps. App block configurations are part of your theme and will be removed if you remove the block.</li>
                <li>If you have specific questions about any data we might hold or wish to exercise any data rights regarding information potentially held directly by us (which should be minimal), please contact us.</li>
            </ul>
            <em>[**Note:** Depending on regulations like GDPR, you might need to list specific rights like rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object.]</em>


            <h2>6. Service Providers (If Applicable)</h2>
            <p>
                We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <em>[**Note:** List any third-party services you use, e.g., analytics for your app's admin, error logging services, cloud hosting if you store data outside Shopify. Be transparent!]</em>
            <p><strong>Example (if you use none directly handling identifiable merchant data for app functionality):</strong> Our app primarily operates within the Shopify platform and does not rely on external third-party service providers for its core functionality that would require sharing your identifiable store data, beyond what is inherently part of the Shopify ecosystem.</p>


            <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service or website may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via a prominent notice on our Service or by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

            <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
